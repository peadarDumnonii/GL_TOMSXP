Since they will run the same protocol, markets will be inter-operable.
Hence cross-market exchanges will often happen. Part of the difficulty
is to compute possible multi-party exchange chains, also referred to as
deals. The protocol will promote openness for facilitating the
computation of the best possible deals.

The search for optimal deals will be eased by SXP by:

-   Allowing for peer-to-peer like exploration of neighbouring market
    contents
-   Allowing for pluggable, third-party deal computation algorithms
