SXP will serve to Secure multi-party contracts. Thus, in case one party
breaks the contract, another party can prove that the contract has been
established. Still, for this to be of some effect, we need to find ways
of:

-   making sure that the contract gets accomplished in the end;
-   making sure that all parties get their fair share;
-   making sure that this does not happen again.

The are various ways of accomplishing subsets of these. SXP will not
favour any of these a priori, but it will provide support for them. SXP
contracts should specify the consequences of breaking a contract.

Trust systems
-------------

Examples: [Couch surfing](http://www.couchsurfing.org),
[e-Bay](http://www.ebay.com) ratings. Parties have a reputation which
they must not jeopardize; breaking a contract would tarnish it.

Insurance policies
------------------

Examples: [Paypal](http://www.paypal.com/), ... The Virtual Market, or a
third party entering the deal, may be paid by the parties in order to
compensate for losses in case one of the parties breaks the deal.

Judiciary system, Arbitrage
---------------------------

Ultimately, the strength of the proof brought by SXP contracts may
enable parties to turn to the judiciary system of their countries.
Sometimes it is unclear which country has jurisdiction; this could be
specified in the contract. Sometimes contracts can even designate a
third party to arbitrage any eventual dispute.
