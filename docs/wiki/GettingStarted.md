This project is at its early stages. We need all the help we can get,
see our [Current Needs](/SXP/wiki/CurrentNeeds "wikilink") and the [Development 
Portal](/SXP/wiki/DevelopmentPortal "wikilink") of the project.

In practice, contributing to this project means setting up an account on
this Wiki, and making this website grow in an orderly fashion, by
bringing in your own expertise. Here are some more informations about
[Getting Started](/SXP/wiki/GettingStarted "wikilink"). You can also

Style of expected contributions
-------------------------------

The main focus of the SXP Wiki is to make progress towards conceiving
and realizing the SXP protocols.

But the SXP ideas naturally lead to interesting considerations in terms
of the potential societal impact of such a system. These considerations
are most welcome in the [discussion 
pages](/SXP/wiki/CategoryDiscussionPages "wikilink"), dedicated to specific
questions, sometimes with specific formats, e.g. Pros and Cons as in
[this page](/SXP/wiki/ExclusiveMoneyBasedEconomy "wikilink"). The direct impact
of such discussion pages will only be to help us take the right design
decisions, on how to best conceive these protocols, whenever these
technical decisions can help improve the Pros and limit the Cons, or
help support future foreseen features.

Generally speaking, contributors are expected to understand that the SXP
protocol is essentially a generalization of current payment protocols,
allowing anyone to exchange anything, anywhere and with anybody - in a
secure way. And to believe that this is worth the shot. They are
expected to bring new questions and solutions in an *orderly fashion*,
towards the accomplishment of the project.
