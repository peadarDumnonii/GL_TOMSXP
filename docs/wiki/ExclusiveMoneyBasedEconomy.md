An exclusive money-based economy is one where goods or services are
systematically exchanged against a fixed notion of money, to the
exclusion of anything else.

Advantages
----------

Exclusively money-based economy seems quite natural to all of us. I has
clear advantages:

-   There is a single reference value
-   ...

Disadvantages
-------------

-   Liquidity problems can cause exchanges that are not otherwise
    dependent on this money, to be halted.
-   It is often unclear who produces this money and for what purpose.
    Nowadays, are Central Banks producing the money, or Private Banks?
-   It is often unclear whether this money is distributed in any
    efficient way to start with, and the distribution is clearly
    difficult to change.
-   Having an exclusive notion of money triggers wealth cumulation
    behaviours, which sometimes are counter-productive.
-   Having an exclusive notion of money favours deals in which the
    relative value of items is made uniform across large regions
    and populations.

Indeed, a more refined point is that, even on a daily basis, money
favours deals in which the relative value of items is made uniform
across large regions and populations. I.e. money makes it difficult to
settle an exchange in which, even if the deal clearly suits all the
parties involved, the deal would seem unfair if rephrased in terms of
standard prices. This point may be a profound one: after all as
individuals we rarely see items as having the same value; otherwise
items would reach some stable distributions amongst us and never be
exchanged again... The entire economy is based on the fact that
different people want different things at different times. Thus, giving
items a single, one-dimensional value may not be optimal in terms of
favouring exchanges, in many situations.
