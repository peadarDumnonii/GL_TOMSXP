Hot topics
----------

-   Understand [Private Contract
    Signatures](/SXP/wiki/PrivateContractSignatures "wikilink").
-   Polish the XML formats of [Contracts](/SXP/wiki/Contracts "wikilink").

Stages
------

The foreseen stages of the project are:

1.  Know what the protocols aim to achieve
2.  Formalize the required properties of the protocols
3.  Formalize the protocols with the required properties
4.  Launch the implementations of these protocols
5.  Produce the graphical interfaces to these implementations
6.  Play with it

Status
------

-   Overall the project is at stage 1-2-3-4 depending on the subtheme.
-   The design the [Secure Contract Signing
    protocol](/SXP/wiki/SecureContractSigningProtocol "wikilink") is at
    stage 3-4.
-   The description of the XML formats of
    [Contracts](/SXP/wiki/Contracts "wikilink") is at stage 3-4.
-   [TODO list](/SXP/wiki/TODOList "wikilink")

Architecture
------------

-   [Protocols](/SXP/wiki/SecureContractSigningProtocol "wikilink").
-   [Contracts](/SXP/wiki/Contracts "wikilink").

Methodology
-----------

### Top-down

The design approach is top-down: we need to know what we want better and
better, with increased precision, until the stage where knowing what we
want means having it.

### Collaborative

The other stages are entirely in the hands of the community that will
develop the project. Notice that this is eased by the fact that until
stage 6 is reached, no software development is needed. Hence everything
can happen on this Website, or links to contributing papers, until then.
This website as you may notice is a Wiki: we hope that its content will
converge to a consensus reached by its contributors.

### Consensus-based

A protocol is a common language. Hence it seems to be a good thing to
elaborate it jointly. Since the protocols that come out of this project
have to be secure against all sorts of attacks, and may eventually serve
as a basis for an exchange-based economy, it is important that designers
be warned of all foreseeable caveats. We believe that only a
consensus-based design can provide this degree of awareness.
