In the real world shops or markets have several beneficial roles: they
facilitate offer/demand encounter, they secure the producer/consumer
exchange, they guarantee the quality of the items, they generate VAT for
the good functioning of states. The protocols will allow for virtual
counterparts of these markets, accomplishing just the same purposes.

SXP will include an ad hoc virtual market creation protocol, whereby
founding members:

-   Establish a market signature
-   Register and publish the availability of items, as well as demands
    for items
-   Allow for possible deals including a possible guarantee policy and
    the required [VAT](/SXP/wiki/RaisingTaxes "wikilink")
-   Witness the resulting muli-party exchanges with the
    market signature.
